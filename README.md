#Chat Bot with OpenAI API
This project is a chat bot built using React, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI (MUI), and Express. It utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing and generating responses. Below is a compact README file with essential information for setting up and running the chat bot.

#Prerequisites
Node.js (version 12 or higher)
OpenAI API key

#Getting Started
1. Clone the repository : git clone <repository_url>
2.Install dependencies: cd <project_directory>
                         npm install
3.Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the project root.

Add the following line to the .env file, replacing <your_openai_api_key> with your actual OpenAI API key: OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
4.Start the development server:npm start

#Configuration
OpenAI API Key: Replace <your_openai_api_key> in the .env file with your actual OpenAI API key. This key is required for the chat bot to interact with the OpenAI API.
#Customization
Frontend: Modify the React components and styles in the src directory to customize the chat bot's appearance and behavior.
